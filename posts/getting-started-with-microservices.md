## The Shift to Microservices

In modern software development, monolithic architectures are increasingly being replaced by **microservice architectures**. This pattern structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services.

### Why Go is a Great Fit

Go, or Golang, is exceptionally well-suited for microservices due to its:
- **Concurrency primitives:** Goroutines and channels make handling concurrent requests trivial.
- **High performance:** Compiled to native machine code.
- **Small memory footprint:** Ideal for deploying multiple services.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
)

func helloHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, Microservice World!")
}

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/", helloHandler)
    fmt.Println("Server starting on port 8080...")
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```
